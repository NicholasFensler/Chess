# Chess
An incomplete version of chess
This program was made as a class assignment/final project for an object orientated programming class.
As the name entails the class is focused on object orientated programming and this project was my first project practicing implementation of objects.
The requirements of the assignment were fairly tight with some wiggle room on implementation and only required the board to:
  A. Print
  B. Accept user input to move
  C. Move pawns, rooks and bishops
  D. use objects to handle the pieces/board data and functions.

unfinished implementations:
  -knights, Queens, Kings, Castle move, en passant, Promotion, Score

Known Errors: 
  -The pawns will always allow the user to move two pieces

How to Use:

(will input later, when code is run instructions are stated on screen)
This program runs in the default console and has no proper UI. just board printing to console.
